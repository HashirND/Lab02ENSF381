          Like many Calgary success stories, ours has a spirited beginning,
          an unprecedented growth spurt and a promising future.
        </h1>
        <p>
          Even before Alberta became a province in September 1905,
          the citizens of a very young Calgary were determined
          to host a post-secondary institution as part of building a great city.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1906, the Alberta Normal School (which would later become our own
          Werklund School of Education) began operations and provided a steady
          stream of educators for a new province eager to grow and advance quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 in Strathcona
          (now part of Edmonton), Calgarians were disappointed with the
          "branch plant" concept that ensued and lobbied for decades
          for an independent institution of their own. Students, faculty,
          staff, alumni, donors and volunteers joined together to support
          the cause, with great passion and commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their dedication was finally rewarded on April 29, 1966 when
          the University of Calgary was granted autonomy. From there,
          growth was fast and furious, as a new campus took shape
          and innovative educators came to Calgary from around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016-17, the University of Calgary marked its 50th Anniversary
          as an autonomous institution.
